- Never commit sensitive data (API keys, credentials)

1. Create release branch from main
2. Update version numbers and CHANGELOG.md
3. Run full test suite
4. Create release tag
5. Merge to main
6. Deploy to production
7. Monitor for any issues

### 8. Hotfix Process
1. Create hotfix branch from main
2. Make minimal required changes
3. Test thoroughly
4. Update version number
5. Merge to main and release branch
6. Deploy to production
7. Document the issue and solution
